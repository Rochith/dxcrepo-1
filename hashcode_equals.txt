Contract between hashcode and equals method:
============================================

1. We must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals().
2. Failure to do so will result in a violation of the general contract for 
   Object.hashcode()
   which will prevent your class from functioning properly in conjunction 
   with all hash-based collections,
   including HashMap , HashSet and Hashtable.

	equals operator ==   test identity
obj.equals(obj)  method compares equality test(i.e we need to tell equality by overriding the method)





3. If two custom object are same but equals() and hashcode() are not overriden then HashSet or HashMap treat them as diff
 and JVM does not know that both are same because as we did not override hc() they get unique hashcodes.
   So we must override both the methods to get proper functionality of Hash-based collections.
